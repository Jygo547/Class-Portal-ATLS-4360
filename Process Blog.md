Hello,

I'm excited to begin the process of designing and building a class portal to keep my work organized during the semester. This portal will also show my love for tech and design.

**The Plan:**

Right from the beginning, I want to make it clear that I want this portal to do more than just hold my assignments. I want it to feel like an online version of me. I'm going to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the class portal and most likely will host it in Vercel later.

**Design Ideas:**

Here are some basic ideas I have for the portal's look and how it works:

**Looks Matter:** I want the portal to look good. I'll try different colors, fonts, and layouts to make it visually appealing.

**Easy to Use:** It has to be easy for anyone to use. I'll make sure people can find what they need without getting lost.

**Space to Grow:** As I do more work, I want to be able to add it to the portal without any trouble. It needs to be flexible.

**Fun Stuff:** I'll think about adding cool things that people can interact with, like moving pictures or interesting information.
