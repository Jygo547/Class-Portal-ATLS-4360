For my Class portal, I decided to focus on adding these to be the main features:
  1. **Course Management:** Creation, scheduling, and management of courses by instructors.
  2. **Content Repository:** Centralized storage for course materials, including documents, videos, and presentations.
  3. **Communication Tools:** Discussion forums, chat, and announcements for student-instructor and peer communication
  4. **Assessment and Grading:** Tools for creating and grading assignments, quizzes, and exams
  5. **Analytics and Reporting:** Tracking and reporting on student progress and performance
  6. **Enrollment Management:** Options for Enrollment, including Self-Enrollment and Manual Enrollment
  7. **Notifications**: Automated reminders and notifications for upcoming assignments and deadlines
  8. **Discussion Boards:** Interactive forums for course-related discussions
  9. **Support and Help Resources:** Access to support, FAQs, and help documentation.

I created a general wireframe of the Home page for this class portal in both desktop and mobile views: https://www.figma.com/file/1Nck5Abnbwl6sXCBDkz2Uz/Class-Portal---Web-Front-End-Development?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=5xru5g8gSpxBV9LM-1

In the Desktop View, all the sections (Classes, Grades, Forums, etc.) are displayed in card format. On the left-hand side of the screen, I will include the navigation bar, which will feature the user name, Full Name, and Student ID at the top.

While in the Mobile view, I have the navbar at the bottom, and all the sections, along with the profile, in the options overlay, which you can access by clicking the button on the top-left side of the screen.

For now, I have just made a low-fidelity wireframe of just the home page, but I will keep designing the screens of the other pages as well to get an idea of how the class portal will look by the 2nd Milestone.
